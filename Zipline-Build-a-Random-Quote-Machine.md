## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: [Random Quotes Rewritten](http://codepen.io/AdventureBear/full/vEoVMw).

## Rules:
1. Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.
2. You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.
3. Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## User Stories:
In software development and product management, a user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.
1. As a user, I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
2. As a user, I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

## Notes:
Note that you can either put your quotes into an array and show them at random, or use an API to get quotes, such as [http://forismatic.com/en/api/](http://forismatic.com/en/api/).

## My HTML Code Snippets
The body section uses one section and a footer. There is nothing new. The way the sections are setup are to make the whole site responsive. I have used the twitter-share-button which is part of the API and code but I didn't want the default Twitter button so I created my own. You can check the documentation for that here: [https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button](https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button)

```html
<section class="container-fluid">
  <h1 class='text-primary'>Random Quotes!</h1>
  <p> This site will display random quotes using the <a href="http://forismatic.com/" target="_blank">Forismatic</a> API. I hope you enjoy them as I learn to work with API and front end. If you want, you can tweet the quotes, it will take you to a new page
    where you might need to edit the post if the quote is too long.</p>
  <div class="well">
    <p class="quote-text"></p>
    <p class="author-text"></p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" id="quote">New Quote</button>
  <a class="twitter-share-button" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet" data-size="large" target="_blank">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Tweet it!</button>
  </a>
</section>

## My CSS Code Snippets
There is no much CSS used here. First I used this site [http://colorsafe.co/](http://colorsafe.co/) for picking colors, size and fonts. I also checked this site [http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) for the default family fonts.
- I gave a new font family to all the paragraphs and anything under the class `container-fluid`.
- I aligned everything at the center.
- gave them respective margins on the sides for styling.
- I gave a new font color, and background color for the body and footer.
- I played around with the `section` elements and footer to make it take the whole page so the footer is at the bottom.

```css
p, .container-fluid {
  margin-right: 10%;
  margin-left: 10%;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
  text-align: center;
  color: #e4f1fe;
  font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';
}
body {
  position: relative;
  background-color: #0d493b;
}
.well {
  margin-right: 3%;
  margin-left: 3%;
  background-color: #0d493b;
}
footer {
  min-height: 8vh;
  padding-top: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 1px;
  background-color: black;
}
section {
  min-height: 91.8vh;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 300;
}
```

## My JavaScript Code
- I have to get the url in the right format.
- create a function to get the object from the API and then use the data.
- It will get the quote, then check if the authors is not an empty string, if it is then change it to `Unknown`
- Return that author.
- I also have it generate a random quote when the page finishes loading.
- When you click the button, there is a function that calls the API to get the data.
- The data is fed to two classes which are actually `<p>` tags to change the text.
- For the twitter part, I created a variable `quot` that will hold a string to be parsed as an url string. It will have the API url, and add parameters like the quote text, with the label Author and the author's name. I also added some self promotion and so I know when people use it as they would tag me. However, the user has full control of what is actually posted as they have to edit and click post before the tweet goes.
- `.attr` is what allowed me to change the link of the `a` tag.

```js
// Random Quote Generator
var url = "http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&key=457653&format=jsonp&lang=en&jsonp=?";
var getQuote = function(data) {
  $(".quote-text").text(data.quoteText);
  var quot = 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=' + data.quoteText + ' Author ' + data.quoteAuthor +' @Rafase282 goo.gl/2h0NHo';
  if (data.quoteAuthor === '') {
    data.quoteAuthor = 'Unknown';
  }
  $(".author-text").text('Author: ' + data.quoteAuthor);
  $(".twitter-share-button").attr("href", quot);
};
$(document).ready(function() {
  $.getJSON(url, getQuote, 'jsonp');

});
$("#quote").click(function() {
  $.getJSON(url, getQuote, 'jsonp');
});
```
