## FreeCodeCamp Journey
This repository is not an app or code for a specific project but a public wiki of my journey while studying Front-End and Full Stack Web Development at FreeCodeCamp. Here you will find the most of challenges and code used. The wiki is not a tutorial or step by step lesson but more of a general record of the tasks and code used.
