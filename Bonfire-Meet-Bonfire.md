# Details
- Difficulty: 0/5

Your goal is to fix the failing test.

First, run all the tests by clicking "Run code" or by pressing Control + Enter.

The failing test is in red. Fix the code so that all tests pass. Then you can move on to the next Bonfire.

Make this function return true no matter what.

None

## Problem Script:

```js
function meetBonfire(argument) {
  // Good luck!
  console.log("you can read this function's argument in the developer tools", argument);

  return false;
}

meetBonfire("You can do this!");
```

## Explanation:
This is very simple, they just want you to get familiar with how their Bonfires work.

## Hint: 1
Read details.

## Hint: 2
Did you read all the details?

## Hint: 3
You need to change the return statement to what they ask.

## My code:

```js
function meetBonfire(argument) {
  // Good luck!
  console.log("you can read this function's argument in the developer tools", argument);

  return true;
}

meetBonfire("You can do this!");
```

## My Code Explanation:
All you had to do was change from false to true.
