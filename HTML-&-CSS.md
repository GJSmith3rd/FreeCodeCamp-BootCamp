## Say Hello to HTML Elements
HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content in between:

`<tagname>content</tagname>` The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

`<p>My first HTML paragraph.</p>`

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>`. Closing tags look like this: `</h1>`  Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket.

## Headline with the h2 Element
You can create different levels of Heading elements by using **h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6** which will result on different sizes.

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

## Inform with the Paragraph Element
`p` elements are the preferred element for normal-sized paragraph text on websites. P is short for "paragraph".

You can create a p element like so: `<p>I'm a p tag!</p>`.

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
```

## Uncomment HTML
Given that there are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:
1. Using `//`
2. Using `<!-- text -->`

You can easily uncomment by just removing the comment elements.

## Comment out HTML
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments within your code without affecting the code itself.

It is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

You can start a comment with `<!-- and end a comment with -->`.

```html
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->
```

## Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text
Web developers traditionally use **lorem ipsum** text as placeholder text. It's called lorem ipsum text because those are the first two words of a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

**lorem ipsum** text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

## Delete HTML Elements
Deleting elements is very simple. All you have to do is remove everything from the opening to the closing of the element and it will be removed. No extra code is needed.

## Change the Color of Text
CSS allows us to change  many styles. To change the color of an element we use `color`.

Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue: `<h2 style="color: blue">CatPhotoApp</h2>`.

```html
<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

## Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements
Instead of giving style attributes one by one, we can do this to multiple elements at the same time.

You can create a style element like this: `<style></style>`.

Inside that style element, you can create a CSS selector for any HTML Elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, your style element would look like this: `<style>h2 {color: red;}</style>`.

Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces `({` and `})` around each element's style. You also need to make sure your element's style is between the opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add the semicolon to the end of each of your element's styles.

```html
<style>
h2{
  color: blue;
}
</style>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

## Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: `<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>`.

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

## Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class
You can attach classes to HTML elements by using `class="your-class-here"` within the relevant element's opening tag.

CSS selectors require a period at the beginning like this: `.blue-text { color: blue; }`, but that class declarations don't use a period, like this: `<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp<h2>`.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

## Change the Font Size of an Element
Font size is controlled by the `font-size` CSS attribute, like this: `h1 { font-size: 30px; }`.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  p{
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p >Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

## Set the Font Family of an Element
You can set an element's font by using the `font-family` attribute.

For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to `Sans-serif`, you would use the following CSS: `h2 { font-family: Sans-serif; }`.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

## Import a Google Font
To import a font from Google or any other site, this is the format that you should follow: `<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`

```html
<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;

  }
  h2{
    font-family: Lobster;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

## Specify How Fonts Should Degrade
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These include `Monospace`, `Serif` and `Sans-Serif`.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the `Helvetica` font, but also degrade to the `Sans-Serif` font when `Helvetica` wasn't available, you could use this CSS style: `p { font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif; }`.

```html
<!--<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> -->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

## Add Images to your Website
You can add images to your website by using the `img` element, and point to an specific image's URL using the `src` attribute.

An example of this would be `<img src="www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">`. Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing.

```html
<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<img src = "https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat">
<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

## Size your Images
CSS has an attribute called `width` that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use `px` (pixels) to specify the image's width.

For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use: `<style> .larger-image { width: 500px; } </style>`.

```html
<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  .smaller-image{
    width: 100px;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat">

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

## Add Borders Around your Elements
CSS borders have attributes like `style`, `color` and `width`.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class: `<style> .thin-red-border { border-color: red; border-width: 5px; border-style: solid; } </style>`.

```html
<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }

  .thick-green-border{
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat">

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

## Add Rounded Corners with a Border Radius
To make round corners it is all about `border-radius` and pixels.

You can specify a border-radius with pixels. This will affect how rounded the corners are.

```css
.thick-green-border {
  border-color: green;
  border-width: 10px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

## Make Circular Images with a Border Radius
You can also use percentage to `border-radius` to make things round.

```css
.thick-green-border {
  border-color: green;
  border-width: 10px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

## Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements
`a` elements, also known as anchor elements, are used to link to content outside of the current page.

Here's an example: `<p>Here's a <a href="http://freecodecamp.com"> link to Free Code Camp</a> for you to follow.</p>`.

## Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph
Nesting is simple, just add one element inside another: `<p> click here for <a href="http://www.catphotoapp.com">cat photos</a></p>`

## Make Dead Links using the Hash Symbol
Replace your a element's `href` attribute with a `#`, also known as a hash symbol, to turn it into a dead link. Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.

This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using jQuery, which we'll learn about later.

## Turn an Image into a Link
Creating images that link to things is essential and one of the most used things in Web Dev. Nest your image within an `a` element. Here's an example: `<a href="#"><img src="http://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats"/></a>`.

## Add Alt Text to an Image for Accessibility
`alt` attributes, also known as alt text, are what browsers will display if they fail to load the image. alt attributes are also important for blind or visually impaired users to understand what an image portrays. And search engines also look at alt attributes.

In short, every image should have an alt attribute!

You can add an alt attribute right in the img element like this: `<img src="www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg" alt="your alt text"/>`.

## Create a Bulleted Unordered List
HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point-style lists.

Unordered lists start with a `<ul>` element. Then they contain some number of `<li>` elements.

For example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```

would create a bullet point-style list of "milk" and "cheese".

## Create an Ordered List
HTML has a special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered-style lists.

Ordered lists start with a `<ol>` element. Then they contain some number of `<li>` elements.

For example:

```html
<ol>
  <li>hydrogen</li>
  <li>helium</li>
</ol>
```

would create a numbered list of "hydrogen" and "helium".

## Create a Text Field
Text inputs are a convenient way to get input from your user.

You can create one like this: `<input type="text">`. Note that input elements are self-closing.

## Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field
Your placeholder text is what appears in your text input before your user has inputed anything.

You can create placeholder text like so: `<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">`.

`<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">`

## Create a Form Element
You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your `form` element. For example: `<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>`.

`<form action="/submit-cat-photo"><input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL"></form>`

## Add a Submit Button to a Form
You will need to create a `button` element. Here's an example submit button: `<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>`.

```html
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Use HTML5 to Require a Field
You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.

For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the word required within your input element, you would use: `<input type="text" required>`.

```html
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Create a Set of Radio Buttons
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer.

Radio buttons are a type of input. They should all be nested in their own label element. Furthermore, all related radio buttons should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a radio button: `<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>`.

```html
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Create a Set of Checkboxes
Checkboxes are a type of input.
- Each of your checkboxes should be nested within its own label element.
- All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a checkbox: `<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>`.

```html
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label>
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default
You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example, `<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>`.

```html
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <label><input type="radio"checked name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox"checked name="personality"> Loving</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label>
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Nest Many Elements within a Single Div Element
The `div` element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all. It's useful for passing the CSS of its own class declarations down to all the elements that it contains.

Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a `div` element with `<div>` and close it on another line with `</div>`.

```html
<div>
 <p>Things cats love:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>cat nip</li>
   <li>laser pointers</li>
   <li>lasagna</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>flea treatment</li>
   <li>thunder</li>
   <li>other cats</li>
 </ol>
</div>
>
```

## Give a Background Color to a Div Element
You can set an element's background color with the `background-color` attribute.

For example, if you wanted an element's background color to be green, you'd use `.green-background { background-color: green; }` within your `style` element.

## Set the ID of an Element
In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an `id` attribute.

There are several benefits to using id attributes, and you'll learn more about them once you start using jQuery.

`id` attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.

Here's an example of how you give your h2 element the id of cat-photo-app: <h2 id="cat-photo-app">

```html
<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }

  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
  .gray-background {
    background-color: gray
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Click here for <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat"></a>

<div class="gray-background">
  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<form action="/submit-cat-photo" id="cat-photo-form">
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label>
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Use an ID Attribute to Style an Element
One cool thing about `id` attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.

Here's an example of how you can take your element with the `id` attribute of cat-photo-element and give it the background color of green.

In your style element: `#cat-photo-element { background-color: green; }`

Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a `.` in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a `#` in front of their names.

## Adjusting the Padding of an Element
HTML elements are essentially little rectangles. Three important attributes control the space that surrounds each HTML element: `padding`, `margin`, and `border`. An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element and its border.

```css
.green-box {
  background-color: green;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

## Adjust the Margin of an Element
An element's `margin` controls the amount of space between an element's `border` and surrounding elements.

```css
.green-box {
  background-color: green;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 20px;
}
```

## Add a Negative Margin to an Element
An element's `margin` controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements. If you set an element's margin to a **negative value**, the element will grow **larger**.

## Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element
CSS allows you to control the padding of an element on all four sides with `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left` attributes.

```css
.green-box {
  background-color: green;
  padding-top: 40px;
  padding-right: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
  padding-left: 40px;
}
```

## Add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element
CSS allows you to control the margin of an element on all four sides with `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left` attributes.

## Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element
Instead of specifying an element's `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-lef`t attributes, you can specify them all in one line, like this: `padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;`.

These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific padding instructions.

```css
.green-box {
  background-color: green;
  padding: 40px 20px 20px 40px
}
```

## Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element
Instead of specifying an element's`margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left` attributes, you can specify them all in one line, like this: `margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;`.

These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific margin instructions.

```css
.green-box {
  background-color: green;
  margin: 40px 20px 20px 40px;
}
```

## Style the HTML Body Element
Every HTML page has the `body` element. and it is like the main page.

## Inherit Styles from the Body Element
The `body` element can be style just like any other.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: Monospace
  }

</style>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

## Prioritize One Style Over Another
Classes to individual elements take priority over general styles.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: Monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text{color: pink;}
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
```

This makes for a pink h1 instead of a green one.

## Override Styles in Subsequent CSS
Your classes will override the body's CSS, if we add a new class that changes the same property, the last one will be the one applied.

## Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes
We can use `id` to override  styling too.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: Monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
  #orange-text{color:orange;}
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text blue-text" id="orange-text">Hello World!</h1>
```

## Override Class Declarations with Inline Styles
Remember, in line styles look like this: `<h1 style="color: green">` They will override everything else that was changing the text color of h1.

## Override All Other Styles by using Important
In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important.

An example of how to do this is: `color: red !important;` This will make sure that we use the wanted property regardless of other overrides.

## Use Hex Code for Specific Colors
With CSS, we use 6 hexadecimal number to represent colors. For example, `#000000` is the lowest possible value, and it represents the color black.

This is the same as `#RRGGBB` which can also be simplified to `#RGB`.

## Use Hex Code to Color Elements White
`0` is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color. `F` is the highest number in hex code, and it represents the maximum possible brightness.

## Use Hex Code to Color Elements Red
Hex code follows the red-green-blue, or rgb format. The first two digits of hex code represent the amount of red in the color. The third and fourth digit represent the amount of green. The fifth and sixth represent the amount of blue.

So to get the absolute brightest red, you would just use `F` for the first and second digits (the highest possible value) and `0` for the third, fourth, fifth and sixth digits (the lowest possible value).

## Use Hex Code to Color Elements Green
Just as with [red](https://github.com/gjsmith3rd/My-FreeCodeCamp-Code/wiki/HTML-&-CSS#use-hex-code-to-color-elements-red) and the others.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #00FF00;
  }
</style>
```

## Use Hex Code to Color Elements Blue
Just as with [red](https://github.com/gjsmith3rd/My-FreeCodeCamp-Code/wiki/HTML-&-CSS#use-hex-code-to-color-elements-red) and the others.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #0000FF;
  }
</style>
```

## Use Hex Code to Mix Colors
Orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #FFA500;
  }
</style>
```

## Use Hex Code to Color Elements Gray
We can also create different shades of gray by evenly mixing all three colors. `background-color: #808080;`

## Use Hex Code for Specific Shades of Gray
We can also create other shades of gray by evenly mixing all three colors. We can go very close to true black. `background-color: #111111;`

## Use Abbreviated Hex Code
red, which is `#FF0000` in hex code, can be shortened to `#F00`. That is, one digit for red, one digit for green, one digit for blue.

This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret `#FF0000` and `#F00` as exactly the same color.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #F00;
  }
</style>
```

## Use RGB values to Color Elements
Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using `rgb` values.

RGB values look like this: `rgb(0, 0, 0)` for black and `rgb(255, 255, 255)` for white.

Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with rbg you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255. `background-color: rgb(0,0,0);`

## Use RGB to Color Elements White
`background-color: rgb(255,255,255)`

## Use RGB to Color Elements Red
`background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0)`

## Use RGB to Color Elements Green
The rgb value green: `rgb(0, 255, 0)`

## Use RGB to Color Elements Blue
The RGB value blue: `rgb(0, 0, 255)`

## Use RGB to Mix Colors
RGB value orange: `rgb(255, 165, 0)`

## Use RGB to Color Elements Gray
RGB value for gray: `rgb(128, 128, 128)`
